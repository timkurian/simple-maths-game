# Simple Maths test

I had taken 30 minutes to write a simple maths test for kids. Its command line only!


## How to run it:

- Download this maths_test.py and .maths_scores to a designated folder, for example `C:\maths_fun`
- Open `powershell` or `cmd` , cd to the designed folder (e.g `cd C:\maths_fun` )
- execute python (or python3) maths_test.py
